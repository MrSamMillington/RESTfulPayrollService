## To post a new employee

`$ curl -X POST localhost:8080/employees -H 'Content-type:application/json' -d '{"name": "Samwise Gamgee", "role": "gardener"}'`

## To alter the user

`$ curl -X PUT localhost:8080/employees/3 -H 'Content-type:application/json' -d '{"name": "Samwise Gamgee", "role": "ring bearer"}'`

## To delete the user

`curl -X DELETE localhost:8080/employees/3`

This by itself is not restful.

I am getting frustrated by the number of people calling 
any HTTP-based interface a REST API. 
Todayâ€™s example is the SocialSite REST API.
That is RPC (Remote Procedure Call).
It screams RPC. 
There is so much coupling on display that it should be given an X rating.

What needs to be done to make the REST architectural style clear 
on the notion that hypertext is a constraint? 
In other words, if the engine of application state (and hence the API) 
is not being driven by hypertext, then it cannot be RESTful 
and cannot be a REST API. 
Period. 
Is there some broken manual somewhere that needs to be fixed?
```

It must be self-describing - HATEOAS. 

Then need to change the return types from `Employee` to `Resource<Employee>`

Rules of REST:

- You can always add columns to a database, but never take away. This will ensure you don't break clients.
    - i.e. if we want to split `name` into `firstName` and `lastName` - leave `name` in there!
    - We can use the `firstName` and `lastName` from the database to construct the `name`.
    
```$xslt
{
  "id": 1,
  "firstName": "Bilbo",
  "lastName": "Baggins",
  "role": "burglar",
  "name": "Bilbo Baggins",
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "http://localhost:8080/employees/1"
    },
    "employees": {
      "href": "http://localhost:8080/employees"
    }
  }
}
```    

## Use HATEOUS to decouple state-based actions from the payload of the data.

Pass valid links, rather than the data itself. I'e instead of handing IN_PROGRESS, handle
enum the options available to anything IN_PROGRESS - like Cancel or Complete.

This naturally reduces coupling between client and server..
